#input: exec o1 log1 ... oN logN

format elfobj64
#modify debian/control exec depends,appimage.yml,debian/control arh order

#at exec only pointers to dataind at text/data
#there is a rare case with rela.dyn but it is not important here (resolved stderr to object)
#these are not position independent code and inplace relocs add better with obj64 but at obj32 use addend>=0 or sum<0 error check

#at shared: pointers
#	.rela.dyn addends from pointers to data section
#		data section offsets (direct:printf, pointers to text/data sections)
